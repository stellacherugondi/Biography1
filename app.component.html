    <h1>Experimentation and Success </h1>
    <p>
      Revenge of the Artist is Dulquer Salmaan’s third outing in Bollywood after Karwaan (2018) and The Zoya Factor (2019).
       One of the biggest stars ofMalayalam cinema who has a fan-following that transcends linguistic barriers, Salmaan was last seen in the multilingual blockbuster hit Sita Ramam, which also starred Mrunal Thakur and Rashmika Mandanna.
       He will be seen in a different avatar in R Balki’s Chup: The Revenge of the Artist alongside Sunny Deol, Pooja Bhatt and Shreya Dhanwanthary. 
       Touted as a psychological thriller, the film’s plot revolves around an artist who turns into a serial killer and targets film critics, engraving star ratings on their body after murdering them.
       The film is also billed as an homage to filmmaker Guru Dutt and his 1959 classic Kaagaz Ke Phool that was trashed by the critics when it was released.

       While everyone is talking about pan-Indian stars like Prabhas, Ram Charan and Jr NTR, there’s one talented Malayalam star who has been taking great strides in Indian cinema with each film of his.
       In just a decade, he has achieved far more than many of his peers in the Indian film industry have.
       From Malayalam to Tamil, Telugu and Hindi cinema, Dulquer has essayed a wide variety of roles and won innumerable awards as well.
